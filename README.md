## Linux Desktop Environment

The [Vixen Shell](https://github.com/vixen-shell) project represents an initiative aimed at creating a user-friendly desktop environment for Linux users, focused on development. Built upon the [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) window manager, this project stands out for its use of Python for the backend and web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the user interface (front-end).

## Client for Displaying User Interfaces

Another essential component of Vixen Shell, this project represents a client allowing the display of Vixen Shell's user interfaces. It utilizes GTK WebKit, a web content rendering platform based on the WebKit engine, and GTK Layer Shell, a library enabling the use of the Wayland protocol for desktop shell components.
